# The-Arcadia-Engine
Your team has been hired by Arcadia Games to build the backend engine for their new MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game). The game requires a highperformance system to handle player data, inventory management, world navigation, and server task scheduling.

# Tasks
- PART A: REGISTORY (Data Structure) --> **done**

- PART B: INVENTORY SYSTEM (Dynamic Programming)
  1. optimizeLootSplit --> **not done**
  
  2. maximizeCarryValue --> **not done**

  3. countStringPossibilities --> **not done**

- PART C: WORLD NAVIGATOR (Graphs)
  1. pathExists --> **not done**
 
  2. minBribeCost --> **not done**
 
  3. sumMinDistancesBinary --> **not done**
 
- PART D: SERVER KERNEL (Greedy) --> **done**


# Notes

- time complexities:
  - Hash table O(1) avg, Skip list O(log n), RB tree O(log n)
  - Knapsack O(n×W), Parition O(n×sum), String O(n)
  - Path O(V+E), MST O(E log V), All-Pairs Shortest Path - APSP O(V³)
  - Scheduler O(n log n)
    
- Do not modify ArcadiaEngine.h under any circumstances.
- DO modify ArcadiaEngine.cpp: You have full freedom to add private helper functions, structs, or classes inside the .cpp file to organize your logic.
- All team members must understand all parts of the project.
- Part A (Data Structures): NO STL containers (Map, Set, etc.) allowed for internal logic. std::vector is allowed only for storage (e.g., Skip List forward pointers).
- Parts B, C, D: You are ALLOWED to use any standard STL containers (Vector, Queue, Map, etc.).
